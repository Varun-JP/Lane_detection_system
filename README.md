# Road Lane Line Detection

The "Road Lane Line Detection" repository contains scripts and resources for developing a system that detects lane lines on roads using image processing techniques. This tool is essential for autonomous driving and driver assistance systems, ensuring safe navigation by identifying lane boundaries accurately.

## Features

- **Lane Detection**: Identify lane lines on roads using edge detection and Hough transform techniques.
- **Video Processing**: Process video streams to continuously monitor lane positions.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Display detected lanes on video frames in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python
- Pycharm IDE
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- MoviePy

 
## Usage
1. Open the Pycharm IDE editor
2. Load the sample video or image files.
3. Run the script to detect and visualize lane lines on the road.
